    * Whitespace inside <...> is now ignored as per the suggestion of
      RFC 3986 appendix C. [rt.cpan.org 20483]

    Other
    * Michael G Schwern is now primary maintainer again.  Thanks for all your
      work, Roderick!
    * Repository moved to http://github.com/schwern/uri-find
    * Now requires Test::More
    * Verisoning scheme changed to ISO date integers
    * Minimum Perl version is now 5.6.0.

    - Oops, make the URI::Find::Schemeless->top_level_domain_re case
      insensitive, as it should be and the docs claimed it was.  Thanks
      to Todd Eigenschink.


0.15 Tue Mar 22 07:23:17 EST 2005
    - Have all functions croak if invoked with the wrong number of
      arguments.  Add URI::Find->badinvo.
        https://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bug.html?id=1845
    - Mention DARREN's urifind script in the man page.
    - Oops, URI::URL::strict was turned on and left on.  Put it back the
      way you found it.  Thanks to Chris Nandor.
        https://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bug.html?id=11906
    - Schemeless.pm:
        - Find '<x>intag.com</x>'.
        - Get $tldRe from a new class method, ->top_level_domain_re.
        - Update top level domain list.


0.14 Sat Oct  9 08:20:04 EDT 2004
    - Add copyright notice.
    - Add ] to main $cruftSet, } to schemeless $cruftSet, for
      [http://square.com] and {brace.com}.
    - quotemeta() $cruftSet.


0.13 Mon Jul  1 10:37:54 EDT 2002
    - Don't find any schemeless URIs with a plain URI::Find.  Previously
      it'd find ones which started with "ftp." and "www.", but it was
      more prone to false positives than URI::Find::Schemeless.
    - Have schemeless_to_schemed use http:// except in the specific case
      in which it uses ftp://.  Remove URI::Find::Schemeless's version.


0.12 Wed Mar 20 14:39:21 EST 2002
    - Improve the "wrap each URI found in an HTML anchor" example.
    - Release a new version so CPAN sees the maintainer change.


0.11 Thu Jul 26 14:43:49 EDT 2001
    - Michael passed the module to Roderick for maintenance.
    - Improve test suite.
    - Tweak URI::Find::Schemeless not to find Foo.p[ml].


0.10  Mon Jul 10 20:14:08 EDT 2000
    - Rearchitected the internals to allow simple subclassing
    - Added URI::Find::Schemeless (thanks Roderick)


0.04  Sat Feb 26 09:05:11 GMT 2000
    - Added # to the uric set of characters so HTML anchors are caught.


0.03  Tue Feb  1 16:15:22 EST 2000
    - Added some heuristic discussion to the docs.
    - Added some heuristics to avoid picking up perl module names
    - Improved schemeless URI heuristic to avoid picking up
      usenet board names.
    - Handling the <URL:...> case better as suggested in RFC 2396 Apdx E
    - Added ; to the cruft heuristic


0.02  Tue Feb  1 13:11:56 EST 2000
    - Added heuristic to handle 'URL:http://www.foo.com'
    - Added heuristic to handle trailing quotes.


0.01  Mon Jan 31 19:12:23 EST 2000
