    - Mention DARREN's urifind script in the man page.
    - Oops, URI::URL::strict was turned on and left on.  Put it back the
      way you found it.  Thanks to Chris Nandor.

    - Schemeless.pm:

    - Add copyright notice.
    - Add ] to main $cruftSet, } to schemeless $cruftSet, for
      [http://square.com] and {brace.com}.
    - quotemeta() $cruftSet.

0.13 Mon Jul  1 10:37:54 EDT 2002
    - Don't find any schemeless URIs with a plain URI::Find.  Previously
      it'd find ones which started with "ftp." and "www.", but it was
      more prone to false positives than URI::Find::Schemeless.
    - Have schemeless_to_schemed use http:// except in the specific case
      in which it uses ftp://.  Remove URI::Find::Schemeless's version.

0.12 Wed Mar 20 14:39:21 EST 2002
    - Improve the "wrap each URI found in an HTML anchor" example.
    - Release a new version so CPAN sees the maintainer change.

0.11 Thu Jul 26 14:43:49 EDT 2001
    - Michael passed the module to Roderick for maintenance.
