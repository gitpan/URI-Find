- new release including copyright
- shouldn't have picked this out:
    $url = 'http://'.rand(1000000).'@anonymizer.com/'.$url (/url 63);
- make the closure optional (for simply counting hits)?
- missed URL
    <Roderick> Jouke:  There's no fix currently.  It's what Freeside is
    pushing SPF to fix (spf.pobox.com).
- find email addresses
    - <freeside> $text =~ s((?<![\/:])([.-_\w]+\@(\w+\.)+\w+))(<A HREF="mailto:$1">$1</A>)g;
