NAME
         URI::Find - Find URIs in arbitrary text

SYNOPSIS
         require URI::Find;

         my $finder = URI::Find->new(\&callback);

         $how_many_found = $finder->find(\$text);

DESCRIPTION
       This module does one thing: Finds URIs and URLs in plain
       text.  It finds them quickly and it finds them all (or
       what URI::URL considers a URI to be.)
